        <br />I am currently in the process of building this site.
        <br />I hope to implement a function that facilitates the purchasing of
        my art via PayPal with the ability to make and except offers!
        <br />
        <br />
        I also hope to include a contact page for commissions and general
        requests.

        In the meantime you are free to enjoy the gallery.
